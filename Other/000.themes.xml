    <h1>Themes</h1>
    
    <p><i>Locating Lord Greystoke</i> approaches the intellectual and cultural history of the African Question from six themes that best represent the scope of American discourse on, the representation of, and the reaction to the African Question: Liberia; the Berlin Conference; the Congo Free State; Missionary Activity and African Religions; Race and Culture; Wars and Resistance; and Emigration and Pan-Africanism.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, each thematic section includes interpretive maps that visualize the geography of the theme, a brief scholarly essay on the theme, and selected primary documents related to the theme (in full or partial text) accompanied by analyses. The final version of the project will also include visualizations such as word clouds, key words in context, word frequency graphs, and annotated photographs and images.</p>

       <h2><a href="berlin.html">Berlin Conference</a></h2>
       
    <p>The Berlin Conference, held during the winter of 1884-85, inaugurated what the British newspaper, <em>The Times</em>, called the "scramble for Africa." Convened by Otto von Bismarck&#8212;Chancellor of the recently unified Germany&#8212;dignitaries representing the United States, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, Russia, Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, and the United Kingdoms of Norway and Sweden gathered in Berlin to reach an international agreement regarding the free navigation of the Congo and Niger Rivers as well as an end to the slave trade. The conference recognized the legitimacy of King Leopold of Belgium's Congo Free State and established procedures for future European claims to territory in Africa.</p>

       <h2><a href="congo.html">Congo Free State</a></h2>

    <p>In 1876, supporters of King Leopold of Belgium's exploits in the Congo Basin established the African International Association (<em>Association Internationale Africaine</em>) to facilitate the "civilization" of Central Africa through exploration, missionary activity, the establishment of trading posts, and the abolition of the internal slave trade. By 1877, there existed an American Branch under the Presidency of John H.B. Latrobe, a lawyer who had been active in the U.S. Liberian colonization project. Delegates from this group attended the annual meetings of the AIA alongside members from "National Committees" representing Belgium, Switzerland, Holland, France, Austria, Germany, and Spain. With the help of British-born, self-identified American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, the AIA and its affiliates would lay the groundwork for the official founding of the Congo Free State in 1885 in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference.</p>
